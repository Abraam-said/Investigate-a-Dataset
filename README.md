# Investigate-a-Dataset
In this project I investigated a dataset called No-show appointments. This dataset collects 
information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether
patients show up for their appointment. To investigate this dataset, I had to use python libraries 
such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. To answer This Dataset question, First I had to identify the
corrupt data like duplicates, unique values and messy rows or columns that needs to be fixed. Then 
I Cleaned the data for it to get ready for the data visualization process to get accurate results to our 
dataset question.
